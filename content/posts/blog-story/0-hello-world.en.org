I had a few blogs before, but was eventually discontinued. One year ago, I tried to create a unique theme for static site generator, but for some reasons (too ugly even in my eyes= =) I rewrote for several times. 

I mainly wrote about some technical short articles, but most of them are not very meaningful (most of time you'd better off reading [[https://wiki.archlinux.org][ArchWiki]]...). Hope this time it would last a bit longer.

Some details about the creation of this blog can be found [[{{< ref "1-some-notes.en.org" >}}][here]].

Yup, that's it for now.
